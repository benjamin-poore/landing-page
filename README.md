## Description

This project is the second Udacity assignment for the Front End Developer program. It uses a JS file to convert a static html/css file into an interactive page.

`js/app.js` has all of the JS to make page interactive

## Usage

Event listeners are used for both onClick and onScroll to update the navbar active tab. The navbar is also created dynamically and could be loaded with information from an API or another source. This page also uses smooth scrolling to scroll to locations. There are views for mobile and desktop.

## Dependencies

None

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.
